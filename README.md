# Friends

This repository lists some of my friends.

It contains several files and each file has the name of a friend. The name can be a full name or only the first name.

The content of a file is a description about my friend written by that that friend.

## Why

This repository exists so that my friends can practice sending pull requests without writing code.

## Adding yourself

To add yourself, follow these simple steps:

* In case this is a private repository, contact me so that I can give you read access.
* Fork this repository.
* Clone the fork to your computer.
* Create a text (.txt) or markdown (.md) file with your name.
* Write about yourself in that file. Make sure the description can uniquely identify you (in case there are others with the same name).
* Commit the change (commit message should be like "added `your name`").
* Push changes to your fork.
* Send me a pull request.
* Contact me and tell me that you have successfully sent the pull request so that I can check and merge your work.

## What I can do

* I might group friends into folders.
* I might change the name of a file (in case there are multiple friends with the same name).
* I will not edit contents of files.

## What you should do when your fork becomes stale

Add a remote to your repository which points to my repo.

When your repo becomes stale, pull changes from my repo and push changes to your fork.
